# Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Backpropagation in Keras

This branch implements the MNIST experiments for the paper [Unsupervised domain adaptation by backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.7495.pdf) with the same model and optimization parameters, including the learning rate and adaptation parameter schedules.

You can download MNIST dataset [2] from [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), and the already synthetic generated MNIST-M from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9Z4d7lAwbnTNDdNeFlERWRGNVk/view).

## Model

The employed DANN is a forked Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that predicts a the class of input digit. The shared part of the network is a feature extractor consisting of a series of convolutional layers that map the input to a discriminative and domain-invariant feature vector f. Afterwards, the network branches into two separated predictors: a label/class predictor and a domain classifier. The former maps the feature vector f to the probabilities of belonging to each of the 10 classes, and the latter maps it to the domain label (0-source, 1-target).

## Running the code

### Data preparation

The structure of the dataset should look like this:

```
path_to_data/
	train/
		source/
			class_0/
				frame_00000.png
				frame_00001.png
				...
			class_1/
			...
			class_9/
		target/
			class_0/
				frame_00000.png
				frame_00001.png
				...
			class_1/
			class_9/
	test/
```

```source/``` folders contain handwritten digits, and ```target``` folders contain synthetic images of digits that have been created from the source ones.

### Training

```
python train.py [flags]
```

Use ```[flags]``` to set paths to training and validation data, number of epochs, batch size, etc. Check ```common_flags.py``` to see the description of each flag.

Example:

```
python train.py --experiment_rootdir "models\model_1"
--train_dir "C:\Users\Ana Maqueda\Data\Anyverse\Datasets\traffic_lights\tl_crops_dann\training"
--val_dir "C:\Users\Ana Maqueda\Data\Anyverse\Datasets\traffic_lights\tl_crops_dann\validation"
--num_epochs 500
--batch_size 250
```
### Evaluation

```
python test.py
```
